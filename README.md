## Task 1:
The answer and explanation for the docking protocol/results can be found in `task_1/Task1.pdf` file.
The top 10 docks models for each compound 18, 13, and 22 can be found in the folder `task_1/results`.
The pymol session containing the superimposition of crystal structure of ERK3-c18, ERK3-c7, and the docking models is `task_1/results/docking_results.pse`
## Task 2:
The implementation and the test cases of the function are included in the iPython notebook: task2.ipynb
To run the code in the iPython notebook, create a new anaconda environment 
```
cd task2
conda env create -f ./task2.yml
```
Then activate the conda environment that you just installed
```
conda activate task2_function
```
Run the iPython notebook with Jupyter lab
```
jupyter lab task2.ipynb
```
